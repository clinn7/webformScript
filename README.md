# webformScript
Complete a webform on a timer
This the very first program I created, trimmed to be edited for any usecase. 
The main function is to repeatedly fill out 2 webforms on a timer.
A bit messy, but you'd be surprised how much cleaner it is from the original version.
chevrons<> and text within must be customized your info
